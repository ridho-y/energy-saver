# Energy Saver ‚ö°Ô∏è

Welcome to Energy Saver! Energy Saver is a web-based application designed to calculate and compare prospective energy plan costs. This application was born out of a personal need to accurately determine how much my electricity bill would cost under different energy plans. Using my historical metered data, I wanted to compare prospective plans with my current one. I found that other tools, such as [Energy Made Easy](https://www.energymadeeasy.gov.au/), were vague in way they calculated prospective costs. So, I decided to develop my own solution that factors in detailed cost calculations such as peak/off-peak rates, seasonal variations and solar feed-in tariffs.
